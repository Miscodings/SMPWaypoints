# SMPWaypoints

A Minecraft Paper/Folia waypoint plugin styled after the waypoint system in Wynncraft.

## Indicator

Selected waypoints display a Wynncraft-style beacon beam made of two `BlockDisplay` entities (an inner colored beam and a slightly wider outer shell) anchored to the terrain surface. A `TextDisplay` floats at the player's eye level showing the waypoint name and distance. The text remains visible through walls via a dual-display approach.

The beam and label clamp horizontally to a configurable min/max radius around the player so it is always visible regardless of distance, without moving with the player.

Key config options (`config.yml` → `pointers.hologram`):

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `minDistanceFromPlayer` | Snaps to the waypoint when within this many blocks |
| `maxDistanceFromPlayer` | Clamps to this horizontal distance when farther away |
| `hologramHeightOffset` | Adjusts label height above player eye level |
| `textScaleNear` / `textScaleFar` | Label scale at min and max distance |
| `textForwardOffset` | Pushes label toward the player so it renders in front of the beam |
| `beam.height` / `beam.width` | Beam dimensions in blocks |
| `beam.block` | Block used for the inner beam |
| `beam.outer.extraWidth` / `beam.outer.block` / `beam.outer.brightness` | Outer shell settings |

## Waypoint Types

- **Private** — visible only to the creating player
- **Public** — visible to all players; shown on supported web maps
- **Permission** — visible only to players with the assigned permission node
- **Death** — created automatically on death; deleted after use
- **Temporary** — session-only, not persisted across logins

## Features

- GUI opened by sneaking and right-clicking with a compass (configurable)
- Organize waypoints into folders
- Share private waypoints with specific players
- Set custom icons for waypoints and folders using the item in your main hand
- Add descriptions to waypoints and folders
- Teleport to waypoints with optional Vault economy cost
- Player tracking — track the live location of another player
- Only one waypoint can be selected at a time; selection clears on logout or server restart
- Multi-world support with automatic Nether ↔ Overworld coordinate scaling
- SQLite storage with configurable periodic backups
- Folia compatible
